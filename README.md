# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

Logistical

    What hours will you be available to communicate? 
    My partner and I have decided to work both in person and on Slack, Remo and Discord.

    What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
    Slack, Remo and Discord.

    How often will you take breaks?
    As needed.

    What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
    Get each other on the ball, so as not to lag too far behind others. Competition is good!

Cooperative

    Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
    We're both friendly and easy to work with each other. He is good with getting help from others, whereas, I can be a little reluctant to ask for help.

    How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
    He asks for help when needed, and I will comply and ask for help when we are both stumped.

    In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
    Both want to strengthen our coding abilities.

    Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
    That's part of the partnership, help each other as needed.

Conflict Resolution

    What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
    That's not likely to happen as we are both in need of help from others.

    What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
    Again, not likely because we need to much help and guidance. Neither is stronger than the other.

    How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
    Get help!
